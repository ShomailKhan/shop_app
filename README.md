Shop App (Flutter + Firebase)

A simple, clean Flutter shopping demo that uses Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore. It showcases a basic e‚Äëcommerce flow: sign in, browse your own products, add new products, view product details with selectable sizes, and manage a cart with Provider.

Key features
- Firebase Authentication stream-based routing (login/sign up -> home)
- Cloud Firestore for storing products scoped by creatorId
- Provider-powered cart state management
- Responsive product list (list on small screens, grid on larger)
- Product details with size selector and add-to-cart
- Simple ‚ÄúAdd Product‚Äù form that writes directly to Firestore

Project structure (high level)
- lib/main.dart: App bootstrap, Firebase init, theme, auth-driven routing
- lib/screens/
	- login_page.dart, signup_page.dart: Auth screens
	- homepage.dart: BottomNav + page switching
	- cart_page.dart: Cart contents using Provider
	- add_product.dart: Minimal form to add products to Firestore
	- product_details_page.dart: Details view with size chips and add-to-cart
	- signout_page.dart: Sign out
- lib/helper_Widgets/
	- homepage_body.dart: Product list (reads Firestore, delete via swipe)
	- product_card.dart: UI card for a product
	- cart_provider.dart: Provider storing cart items
- lib/firebase_options.dart: Generated by FlutterFire CLI
- assets/images/: Demo images referenced by products

Tech stack
- Flutter 3 (Dart SDK ^3.9)
- Firebase Core, Auth, Cloud Firestore
- Provider for state management

Authentication flow
The app‚Äôs home is driven by auth state using a StreamBuilder in main.dart:
- Waiting -> shows a progress indicator
- Logged in -> Homepage()
- Logged out -> LoginPage()

On the Login and Sign Up screens, successful auth automatically navigates to Home because the StreamBuilder detects the new state (no manual push required).

Data model (Firestore)
Collection: products
- id: string (user-entered product id, not the Firestore doc id)
- title: string
- price: number (double)
- image_url: string (asset path or network URL)
- company: string
- sizes: array<number> (e.g., [7, 8, 9])
- creatorId: string (FirebaseAuth.currentUser.uid)

Reading products
The product list shows only documents for the signed-in user:
	where('creatorId', isEqualTo: currentUser.uid)

Deleting a product
Swipe to dismiss (left-to-right) will delete the item:
- We use the document snapshot‚Äôs id (product.id) to call .doc(product.id).delete()

Adding a product
Screen: lib/screens/add_product.dart
- Very simple form with TextFields: id, title, price, image_url, company, sizes
- sizes can be comma- or space-separated (e.g., 7, 8, 9)
- On Submit, a map is built and added to Firestore; a SnackBar shows the doc id

Product details and sizes
- Product details page displays title, image, price
- Sizes are presented as chips; tap to select a size
- Add to cart requires selecting a size first (feedback by SnackBar)

Cart
- Uses Provider (cart_provider.dart) to store added products
- cart_page.dart reads Provider to display the list

Setup and run
1) Firebase project
- Install FlutterFire CLI
- Run: flutterfire configure (select your Firebase project)
- This creates/updates lib/firebase_options.dart
- Android: keep Google Services plugin enabled (already configured). Place google-services.json in android/app if you use auto-discovery; otherwise firebase_options.dart is sufficient for manual init.

2) Dependencies
- flutter pub get

3) Assets
- The pubspec includes assets/images/. Ensure your images are in that folder (e.g., assets/images/shoes1.jpg)

4) Run
- flutter run

Recommended Firestore rules (for development only)
Allow signed-in users to read/write only their own products:

service cloud.firestore {
	match /databases/{database}/documents {
		match /products/{docId} {
			allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.creatorId;
		}
	}
}

Troubleshooting
- Spinner not showing long enough at startup: Auth check is very fast; that‚Äôs normal.
- Firestore write ‚Äúpermission denied‚Äù: Check rules; ensure you‚Äôre signed in.
- No data on device in release: Ensure Android INTERNET permission is present in main manifest.
- Web TypeError: List<dynamic> is not List<int>: Avoid casting List<dynamic> to List<int>; convert elements one-by-one (implemented in product_details_page.dart).
- Already logged in unexpectedly: Firebase persists auth; sign out to test fresh.

| Login | Sign Up |
|---|---|
| ![Login](screenshots/login.png) | ![Sign Up](screenshots/signup.png) |

How to add/update screenshots

1) Create the folder at the repo root:
	 - screenshots/
2) Add PNG/JPG images (recommended width 1080px or 1242px for clarity).
3) Reference them in this README using either Markdown:
	 ```md
	 ![Login](screenshots/login.png)
	 ```
	 or HTML for sizing:
	 ```html
	 <img src="screenshots/login.png" width="280" />
	 ```

Contributing / extending
- Replace the minimal add_product.dart with your preferred form/validation
- Add image picker and upload to Firebase Storage
- Expand cart to handle quantities and checkout
- Add filtering/search bound to Firestore queries
